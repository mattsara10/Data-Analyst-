# Welcome to My Data Analysis Portfolio
Hello! My name is Matt, and I am a passionate data analyst with a deep love for basketball and soccer.  I have been working in IT for a few years, specialize in data visualization, cleaning, and modeling to help organizations make data driven decisions.

This repository is a collection of all my data analyst projects.  The purpose of this repository is to show case my data analysis skills and love for sports.  Each project posted to this GitHub will document the data analysis process, and my creative thinking.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you would love to collaborate in the future.
